Oakhaven Tic Tac Toe Championship is
about to begin. The prize money...
REFEREE:
$1...huh?$3
Wait a second! The chest with the prize
money is empty! Nobody leave the room,
REFEREE:
this is now a crime scene!

REFEREE:
Don't worry. We're locking this place down.
Nobody in, nobody out, until the detective
arrives and we can figure out who the thief is.
REFEREE:
It's just like a murder mystery novel. Except
without the murder. Or the novel, I guess.
So it's just a mystery.

REFEREE:
Did you see that?! I suppose you did. Good
job finding that suspicious character... but,
poor job stopping her. At any rate, the money
REFEREE:
is gone, and we can't have our tournament
anymore. Well, forget about that 200 crowns,
kid.
TILIA:
What if I can find the girl. Or the money.
Or both?

REFEREE:
Oh, you're in the Volunteer Navy, aren't you?
Looking for trouble? To solve it? Well fine. If
you get the money back, you get a cut.

REFEREE:
Did you find that girl that stole the
tic-tac-toe prize money?

TILIA:
I'm still looking.


REFEREE:
I've got the town guards on the case too.
This is the heist of the century! I'm planning
to write a book.

REFEREE:
Did you track down the money that girl
stole?

TILIA:
As a matter of fact, I did.


REFEREE:
No kidding! We can have the tournament
after all! We won't need you to join anymore,
since the thief is obviously disqualified, but
REFEREE:
I'll let you keep half of this. The town guard
was useless in finding the thief, so we
wouldn't have this if it weren't for you.

Thanks to you, we can continue to have

You should train and try out next year.

I've been reading collected poetry about the
ancient lighthouses scattered across the
islands. They were built to call back a
lover lost at sea. The way they're darkened,
dead, reminds me of this tree. Except I
guess probably don't try to light this tree
on fire. You definitely could light all
four lighthouses back up.

Did you hear the governor's dog is having
a birthday party? Or, they're having a
party for the governor's dog. Or is he the
mayor? The person, I mean, not the dog.
Or is the dog the mayor? I mean, I don't
have a strong grasp of politics.

Hey, this might seem like a weird warning,
but be careful around the fountains in
Oakhaven. My little sister fell down a
well last week. She said it was pretty
creepy down there too. She got the feeling
she could hear something whispering to
her from deeper down the tunnel. Also, she
broke her arm!
