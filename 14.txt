about this, his sword was supposed to be

Exactly. I assumed that legend was about
the sword he battled with, but most records
I've been reading, he destroyed armies

stuff. And then there's the story in this

HAZEL:
the Sea King offering his sword to the Sea

wonder if he left it there.

These trees are called Manna Oaks. From
what I can tell, the Sea King had them
planted ages ago. A man named Amalenchier
HAZEL:
tended to them, and cared for them as all
the other trees on Oakhaven grew around
their root system. Amalenchier lived where

Sure, here.

the blight too. It seems to be coming from

their roots, up through their cambrium. But
if they're all sick... do their roots all
connect? $1...$3Alright. Can you go to Ivystump

Amalenchier figure lived, someone there
would know?
