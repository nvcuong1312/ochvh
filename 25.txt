CAPTAIN THYME:
Hmm. Sounds right. Nothing but trouble from
Limestone Island. Was what, six months ago
Blackbeard sent us to your island, yeah?
TILIA:
That's right. Almost burned down my family's

Hazel?
CAPTAIN THYME:
Girl, I'm sorry. Look, I was a member of
the Pirate Council. Group of captains that
Blackbeard got together. He'd sent my crew
CAPTAIN THYME:
out lootin' old shrines, looking for some
magic amulet we eventually found in Spruce
Head. That's why we was in Limestone. It
CAPTAIN THYME:
was right soon after I sent that amulet off
to Blackbeard that another person from
Limestone Island showed up here... Same

he beat up my whole crew. Gave me a whoppin',
and rescued the Hazel girl. Me crew left me

after that, said they'd had enough, didn't
want to work for the Pirate Council. And
honestly, I don't either. I've given up
CAPTAIN THYME:
on pirating, I'm just hiding out here,
hoping Blackbeard won't find me. But I've
been thinking, and regretting what I did
CAPTAIN THYME:
for that man, so I'll tell ya this. Hazel
and your dad sailed for Oakhaven Island.
Dunno why, but you might find them there.
TILIA:
...So you really regret working for
Blackbeard? I thought for sure I'd be
fighting you.
CAPTAIN THYME:
I lost so badly to your dad that I don't
think I have another fight in me. That's
another reason, if I don't help Blackbeard

to send down to the seabed to fight the
