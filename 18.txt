You're Morus, right? I heard from my friend

Al-Jazari. I want to help you. I need some
TILIA:
information from him. The location of the
Pirate Council's hideout.

MORUS:
Huh, alright. That greasy, bolt-toothed
nut sank two of my ships. But here's what
you don't understand. Al-Jazari makes
MORUS:
automatons for the Pirate Council. Steam-
powered, metal demons. So besides two
foot thick iron gates at his fort, he's got a
MORUS:
giant crew of council pirates. Ain't no way
an old man like me with a girl like you, or
even a team of thirty men could get in.
TILIA:
Hmm. Don't they have like, a back door or
something?

MORUS:
Nope. And they've got plenty of manpower
to watch for sneaker-in-ers. Honestly, I don't
know how they feed them all down at Fort Crow.
TILIA:
$1Hmm... $3Oh! Well here's what you don't understand.
If you want to get into a pirate fort, you
don't have to kick down the doors and fight
TILIA:
every pirate. Although I would. But we can
be clever, not strong. Where do the pirates
get their ale? Pirate forts always need ale.
MORUS:
Eh. I hadn't thought of that. I don't know.


TILIA:
Because we could slip some sleeping-powder
or something into their drinks, and we
wouldn't need to fight eighty guys. Is there
TILIA:
like, an apothecary or something in town?


MORUS:
Yeah, up on the east side of town. Alright.
I can find out where the pirates at Fort
Crow get their grog if you can get something
MORUS:
effective to put inside a shipment.
