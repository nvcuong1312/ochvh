Heey! Welcome to my invention shop. So,
this is gonna sound super weird, but do
you have a flail? Like, a ball and chain?
TILIA:
Uh, yeah, I do actually.


PROMETHEUS JONES:
No way! See, I have this idea! It's like,
it's that. But it explodes! Bam! Everything
it touches, it just causes an explosion.
TILIA:
That sounds like a really bad, really
dangerous idea.

PROMETHEUS JONES:
Yeah, you'd probably just hurt yourself!
Want me to do it? I can change it back
later if you want?

Hey! It's exploding flail lady! How is

I mean... it's a lot.


PROMETHEUS JONES:
Right! It's probably way worse for anything
practical than just a normal flail! It's
suuuuuper cool. Man, just fire everywhere.
PROMETHEUS JONES:
Soooo... you don't want me to change it
back, do you?

Keep this on the down-low, but my crew was

How to read a map:
Open the menu to see your map. To determine
your location, search for landmarks you
can see, such as coastlines, bridges,
or towns, and try to find corresponding
areas shown on the map. Keep in mind,
not everything is shown on a map.
